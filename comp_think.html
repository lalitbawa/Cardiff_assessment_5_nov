    <p>Computational Thinking refers to the process of visualizing ideas and creating something from the scratch, in a way which the machine understands. It is the most basic module in our entire course yet, the most important one as it helps to lay out the thinking process for an individual to efficiently work with machines. As an aspiring Web Developer, It really helped me to understand the basics of web development which will help me to pursue my dream career as a Web Developer. Not only this, Computational thinking also gives you a basic idea of whatâ€™s about to come next and, to prepare for upcoming challenges.</p>
